# SpawnerCraft 3.0

SpawnerCraft for Minecraft 1.9 and 1.10.

I don't like the whole re-do-the-whole-thing that I've done twice now, but it seemed like the easiest way to update, for me.
The first time, it was necessary because the original was a mess. Now, it's because I can't seem to get Forge 1.10 to build in the old project.

SpawnerCraft is a "Nearly Vanilla" mod.
This series intends to introduce small gameplay changes into the game to make more things within the game available and convenient, while maintaining balance.

SpawnerCraft allows a player to create their own spawners wherever they wish, while (by default) still requiring the player to find a generated spawner,
therefor keeping the element of exploration and reward in vanilla, while adding the possiblility to move spawners (with a bit of work)
or even obtain a non-standard spawner that is not available in a survival map normally.
